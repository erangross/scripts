#allow running wmi from command line 

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

#check if wmi is enabled
sc query winmgmt

#start wmi service
sc start winmgmt

#check if the firewall blocks wmi
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="windows management instrumentation (WMI-in)"

#Enable winrm. On the computer, you want to access.
#Check if winrm is running or stopped:

get-service winrm
If it is stopped, type:

enable-PSRemoting -force
Add access permission to the remote host.

winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="REMOTECOMPUTERNAME/IP"}'
So in my case:

winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="laptopPC"}'
To verify the winrm service, you can type:

#To eanable the changes needed
Set-NetConnectionProfile -NetworkCategory Private


winrm quickconfig
It will give the current status of the service and if needed, it will configure the WinRM service.

winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="EranGrossPCNew"}'
